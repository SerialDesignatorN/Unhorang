# Unhorang
A third-party editor and packager for HorangHill games

## Why the name is "Unhorang"?
At first, I thought it would be a parody to stitch in "Unreal" and "HorangHill". People might mistake it as "UE1", which was Unreal Engine 1, so I abbrievated it to "UHE1" which means Unhorang Engine 1.
